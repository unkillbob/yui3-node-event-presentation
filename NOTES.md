Node
====

### What is Node?

- DOM abstraction
- Y.DOM
- Wraps HTML element -> better API

### The One

- Y.one
- CSS selectors -> back to front
- IDs
- not null-safe

### Node

- add/remove class
- set/get attributes
- chaining
- Node.one

### NodeList

- collection of Nodes
- mostly same API as Node
- null/empty safe
- events? -> rather use delegation (later)

_Topics that need to go somewhere, just not sure where._

- modules (node-base, event-base, etc)
- caching nodes (i.e. saving references)
